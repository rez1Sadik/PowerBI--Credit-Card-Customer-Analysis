## Introduction

A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction.

The aim of this project is to exhibit my skills in analyzing and visualizing credit card data with user friendly navigation using Power BI.

The Report consists of five pages:

-  Home 
-  Demographic
-  Avg. Utilization vs Credit limit
-  Key Influencers
-  Customer Profile


## Data Source 
I have used the data available at Kaggle website (_[Credit Card customers dataset, 2021](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshigoyal7/credit-card-customers)_). The dataset fulfils the requirements for the project and is in the CSV format.

## Problem Statement

A business manager of a consumer credit card portfolio is facing the problem of customer attrition. They want to analyze the data to find out the reason behind this and leverage the same to predict customers who are likely to drop off.

   



## Findings and Visualization

Here, the following insights could be discovered:

1. __Demographic__: 
     -  Average period of relationship with the bank is 3 years. 
     -  Average customer age is 46 years. 
     -  Blue card has the highest percentage of consumers almost 94%. 
     -  The Q&A portion is going to help the user build reports based on autometic queries swiftly.

2. __Avg. Utilization vs Credit limit__:
   -  Based on the average credit limit and average utilization ratio we can identify that people with low income has lower credit limit and high credit card avg. utilization rate.

3. __Key Influencers__:
   -  For the better representation of the population relatice count type is used in the analysis and sorted by count. 
   -  Taking the following image as an example, it might be tempting to choose the key influencer who has been inactive for 0 or less months over the past 12 months. However, given that it only has 29 instances, that would only offer incorrect insight.
   -  One of the main determining factors is whether a client has been inactive for at least two months during the previous 12 months. This is more logical.

   -  The average utilization ratio being under 0.25 is another deciding factor. This suggests that the customer is making use of a different brand of credit card. Because people's spending habits are hard-wired, they prefer to swap out commodities (like credit cards) for better ones.
